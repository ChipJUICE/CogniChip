# Adaptive Peripheral Power Management System

**PowerNap** is an adaptive, multi-peripheral **power management and clock-gating subsystem** designed and developed using the **CogniChip hardware design platform**.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end RTL design flow — from AI-assisted module generation to system-level simulation and synthesis — with a strong focus on **reducing switching activity and dynamic power** in SoC peripherals.

All modules were developed, integrated, simulated, and synthesized inside **CogniChip**, leveraging its OpenCOS-based simulation flow and Yosys-driven synthesis backend.

- Runtime-programmable power management
- Fine-grained **clock gating** for power reduction
- Fully verified using **Verilator**
- Synthesized using **Yosys** (via CogniChip)
- Clean separation of RTL, simulation, and synthesis artifacts

## 🧠 System Overview

The design targets an SoC-style environment with multiple peripherals exhibiting bursty and idle-heavy workloads.

Each peripheral is independently monitored and dynamically transitioned between power states to minimize unnecessary clock toggling and switching activity.

### Power States
- **ACTIVE** — Clock enabled, full operation
- **IDLE** — No recent activity, monitoring phase
- **SLEEP** — Clock gated, minimal switching activity

## 🧩 Module Descriptions

### 1️⃣ `cfg_regs` — Configuration & Control Registers   
Provides a programmable interface to control power behavior at runtime.

### 2️⃣ `activity_counter` — Activity Monitoring   
Tracks whether peripherals are active or idle.

### 3️⃣ `idle_predictor` — Adaptive Idle Logic   
Determines when a peripheral is eligible to enter SLEEP mode.

### 4️⃣ `power_fsm` — Power State Machine   
Controls the power state of each peripheral.

### 5️⃣ `clock_gater` — Clock Gating Logic   
Generates gated clocks for peripherals to reduce switching activity.

### 6️⃣ `perf_counters` — Performance Metrics   
Provides observability into power behavior.

### 7️⃣ `pwr_ctrl_top` — Top-Level Integration  
Integrates all submodules into a single SoC-ready block.
